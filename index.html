	<p>This course is an under-graduate level introduction to Algorithms with a focus on software challenges. We will cover multicore architectures, memory models, transactional memory, locking schemes, concurrent data structures, multicore programming languages, debugging including race detection and model checking, and performance analysis and optimizations.</p>
	<p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p>
	<p>Sequential software scales linearly with speed of a single core. It is as if hardware designers are limiting software speed. But due to heat generated by fast cores, chip designers have now hit a wall trying to speed up cores. The only way forward for them is to make the speed a little slow and increase the number of cores. There is no heat wall here. They can design as many cores as they want with corresponding reduction in speed. But now the limiting factor is software and the pressure is on software designers to parallelize their implementations so that hardware designers can introduce more cores. This has made it inevitable for software designers to leave the comfortable and simple to understand world of sequential software and understand the complexities of multicore systems where architectural details don’t remain hidden (e.g. memory models and cache coherence), where bugs often don’t reproduce with the same inputs, and where performance sometimes decreases on multiple cores and sometimes increase beyond what is mathematically possible (super-linear speedup). You should take this course if you want to pursue a career in software design and development or if you want to research in architecture, operating systems, software reliability, program analysis, or programming languages.</p><p><strong>Why should you not take this course?</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Attendance is mandatory (see policy below). Do not take this course if you cannot be in class on time.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>This course involves reading and discussing research papers. Research papers are not written like a book. You need to skim them before class, discuss them, be attentive in the lectures, and then again read them thoroughly after class to grasp them. If you cannot give time approximately to one paper per week, do not take this course.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>This course involves programming assignments. Do not take this course if you don’t like programming. A litmus test to see for yourself if you have enough programming expertise is to ask yourself if you can implement a binary search tree in the language of your choice right now without help and without Internet.
